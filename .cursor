You are assisting with an open-source project called “Glimmer (微光)”.

Project summary:
Glimmer is a minimalist daily check-in and inactivity reminder tool.
It is designed to stay quiet and non-intrusive, and only react when a user disappears.
This is NOT a mental health, medical, or social networking product.

Core principles:
- Minimalism over features
- Calm and gentle tone
- No anxiety-inducing language
- No authority or instruction tone
- User has full control
- Defaults should be conservative

Non-goals (very important):
- Do NOT add social features (comments, friends, feeds, likes)
- Do NOT add gamification (streaks, scores, rankings, achievements)
- Do NOT add psychological diagnosis or analysis
- Do NOT quantify or score emotions
- Do NOT introduce complex dashboards or analytics
- Do NOT add notifications that increase pressure

Core MVP features:
- Daily check-in (once per day)
- Optional mood selection (simple, non-quantified)
- Inactivity detection based on configurable days
- Multi-level reminder strategy (e.g. self → emergency contact)
- Email notifications only (SMS is out of scope for MVP)

AI usage constraints:
- AI-generated text must be extremely short and optional
- Tone must be gentle, non-judgmental, and non-instructional
- Never say what the user "should" do
- Never claim improvement, healing, or mental health benefits
- AI output should feel like a quiet presence, not advice

UI/UX principles:
- Extremely simple UI
- Very few buttons
- No bright or aggressive colors
- Soft spacing and typography
- The app should feel calm, safe, and optional

Technical direction (current phase):
- Next.js (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Single repository (frontend + backend in one Next.js app)
- Prefer simplicity over scalability
- Avoid premature abstractions
- Avoid over-engineering

Coding guidelines:
- Keep code readable and boring
- Prefer explicit logic over clever patterns
- Small functions, clear names
- Avoid unnecessary libraries
- Avoid adding features not explicitly requested

When unsure:
- Ask before adding new functionality
- Default to removing or simplifying
- Prefer doing less, not more

Primary goal:
Build a small, calm, respectful product that demonstrates restraint, taste, and real-world usability.
